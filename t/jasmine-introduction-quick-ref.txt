raise exceptions
Ran 1 of 66 specs - run all
1 spec, 0 failures
A suite
contains spec with an expectation
A suite is just a function
and so is a spec
The 'toBe' matcher compares with ===
and has a positive case
and can have a negative case
Included matchers:
The 'toBe' matcher compares with ===
The 'toEqual' matcher
works for simple literals and variables
should work for objects
The 'toMatch' matcher is for regular expressions
The 'toBeDefined' matcher compares against `undefined`
The `toBeUndefined` matcher compares against `undefined`
The 'toBeNull' matcher compares against null
The 'toBeTruthy' matcher is for boolean casting testing
The 'toBeFalsy' matcher is for boolean casting testing
The 'toContain' matcher is for finding an item in an Array
The 'toBeLessThan' matcher is for mathematical comparisons
The 'toBeGreaterThan' is for mathematical comparisons
The 'toBeCloseTo' matcher is for precision math comparison
The 'toThrow' matcher is for testing if a function throws an exception
A spec
is just a function, so it can contain any code
can have more than one expectation
A spec (with setup and tear-down)
is just a function, so it can contain any code
can have more than one expectation
A spec
is just a function, so it can contain any code
can have more than one expectation
nested inside a second describe
can reference both scopes as needed
Pending specs
can be declared 'xit'
can be declared with 'it' but without a function
can be declared by calling 'pending' in the spec body
A spy
tracks that the spy was called
tracks all the arguments of its calls
stops all execution on a function
A spy, when configured to call through
tracks that the spy was called
should not effect other functions
when called returns the requested value
A spy, when configured to fake a return value
tracks that the spy was called
should not effect other functions
when called returns the requested value
A spy, when configured with an alternate implementation
tracks that the spy was called
should not effect other functions
when called returns the requested value
A spy, when configured to throw a value
throws the value
A spy
can call through and then stub in the same spec
A spy
tracks if it was called at all
tracks the number of times it was called
tracks the arguments of each call
tracks the arguments of all calls
can provide the context and arguments to all calls
has a shortcut to the most recent call
has a shortcut to the first call
can be reset
A spy, when created manually
is named, which helps in error reporting
tracks that the spy was called
tracks its number of calls
tracks all the arguments of its calls
allows access to the most recent call
Multiple spies, when created manually
creates spies for each requested function
tracks that the spies were called
tracks all the arguments of its calls
jasmine.any
matches any value
when used with a spy
is useful for comparing arguments
jasmine.objectContaining
matches objects with the expect key/value pairs
when used with a spy
is useful for comparing arguments
Manually ticking the Jasmine Clock
causes a timeout to be called synchronously
causes an interval to be called synchronously
Asynchronous specs
should support async execution of test preparation and expectations
