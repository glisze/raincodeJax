<h1>About this Project</h1>

<p>
The current focus, here, is to make some progress towards utility ECMAscript programs.
They target a tablet thing and they intend to add functionality <em>on the move</em>.
</p>
<p>
A part of this views facilities that are available, online. This project uses
the <a href="http://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud</a> to make provide the path
to these tools.
</p>

<h2>Some Ways along this Path are noticed</h2>

<p>
 Deployment using <code>git push</code> takes its time. To releave the pressure from
the <code>git 'deployer'</code> the command line is given within a <code>nohup</code>
command. The terminal session can be terminated, while the <code>'deployer'</code>
can have its time to do its work.
<pre><code>

 nohup git push &amp;

 tail -f nohup.out

</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p>
Planning the next steps. In this case towards business technology. Touching the cloud...
</p>

<ol>
<li>Move into the <a href="http://cloud.google.com/console#/projects">Cloud of the Googles</a></li>
<li>Enable, clone, add this file, push, make a change, commit, push, purpose: validate things</li>
<li>Configure, towards web access</li>
<li>add content, mathJax, add a simple Math TeX</li>
<li>...plan further developments</li>
<li>...plan development workflow, include testing, include agilities, include acceptance testing</li>
<li>...plan, re-cycle</li>
<li>eventually... use</li>
</ol>

<h2>Things to try</h2>

<p>
The Google drive test has been tried. With success. The Google Drive API is working for us.
Lets look for paths ahead.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
  Running a <a href="/t/SpecRunnerGoogleDrive.html">Google Drive test spec</a>
</li>
<li>
  Running the <a href="/d/google-drive.html">Google Drive Quickstart</a> example.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Things to know how to do</h2>

<p>
<code>YAML</code> has lost its ability to baffle. And some lines are seen that guide towards
a working path. Keeping a lookout for best ways, and directions.
</p>
<p>
Ways of testing ECMAscript have been revisited, and road-signs to new ways appeared in view.
The move towards some of these testing paths is expected; soon. No promises, though. <!-- talking to myself -->
</p>
<p>
Beaviour Driven Development. Agile Development. Mock Objcts. Chemistry. Diversity the <code>great</code>.
</p>
<p>Ready to deplay...</p>
<ol><li>
 <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig#Python_app_yaml_About_app_yaml">
     app.yaml
   </a> defines the effective <code>URLs</code> of these pages.
 </p>
</li>
<li>
 <p>
  <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html">Jasmine introduction.</a>
   Behaviour Driven Development. How does the program behave.
   Describe it. Expect predictable behaviour.
